saving network:
./save_configs.sh

pushing to git:
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main

Step 1: 
configuring router:
configure terminal
interface <interface_name>
ip address <ip-address>

connecting host to router:
ip addr flush dev <routerName>router
ip addr add 88.10Y.0.1/24 dev <routerName>router
ip route add default via 88.10Y.0.2 dev <routerName>router

see all of the router's interfaces:
show interface brief


Step 2: 
Issue with setting host interface of the router to 0.1 rather than 0.2. Found out that host interface of the router is different to the host being talked about in the assignment

Step 4: 
configure terminal
router ospf
ospf router-id <loopbackAddress>
network <networkAddress>/24 area 0.0.0.0
redistribute connected


check router:
show ip ospf interface

check host:
tcpdump -i <router_name>router proto ospf

step 9: 
iperf3 -s
iperf3 -c <serverAddress>


step 11:
configure terminal
interface <interfaceName>
ip ospf cost 30
